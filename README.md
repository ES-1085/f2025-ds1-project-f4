## Summary

This project deals with economy and regime. Specifically, we inquire on the relationship between countries’ economy and their regime. We ask how a country’s economy determines its regime measured in democracy and dictatorship continuum. We use regime and economic indicators collected from the Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) dataset and World Development Indicators (WDI) dataset of the World Bank, respectively. V-Dem provides the five indices of democracies, while WDI provides economic indicator measured in GDP per capita.

(1) How does the region mediate the relationship? 
(2) What historically relevant events one notices that affect both the economy and regime?
(3) Can it be that the regime determines the economy?
